      <h1>Squominoes</h1>
      
      <div>
        <h3>
          General Rules:
        </h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Shuffle the deck and deal 6 cards to each player.</li>
          <li>Place the rest of the deck face down.</li>
          <li>The youngest player goes first and plays a Squominoe card.</li>
          <li>Pick up a card from the deck after you play one.</li>
          <li>Players take turns connecting their cards to the ones on the table (clockwise).</li>
          <li>The goal is to get rid of as many cards as possible.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>
          Special Cases:
        </h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>If you can't play, pick up cards until you can.</li>
          <li>If the table is full, add up the numbers on your remaining cards. The player with the lowest total wins.</li>
          <li>If a player has no cards left, they win!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          Play Area Size (depends on players):
