          General Rules:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Shuffle the deck.</li>
          <li>Deal each player six (6) cards.</li>
          <li>Place the remaining cards face down to the side.</li>
          <li>The youngest player places a Squominoe first.</li>
          <li>Once you play a card, don't forget to pick one up from the deck.</li>
          <li>Going clockwise, the next player will connect one of their cards to a card on the table.</li>
          <li>The goal is to try and get rid of as many of your cards as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>If you can't play any Squominoes, keep picking up from the deck until you can.</li>
          <li>If the play area is full, total up all of the numbers on every one of your cards, the lowest number wins.</li>
          <li>If a player has no cards left in their hand, they win.</li>
          <li>The play area is determined by the amount of players...</li>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>2 Players - 3 x 3 grid</li>
            <li>3 Players - 4 x 4 grid</li>
            <li>4 Players - 5 x 5 grid</li>
            <li>and so on... <br>
          </ul>
        </ul>
