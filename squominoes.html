          General Rules:
        </h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Deal: Each player gets 6 cards.</li>
          <li>Start the Game: The first player places a card on the table.</li>
          <li>Take Turns: Players take turns placing a card that connects to the last card played. If you can connect to more than one card, you may play an extra card for each connection.</li>
          <li>Draw a Card: After each turn, draw a card from the deck.</li>
          <li>Can't Play?: If you can't play a card, draw one and skip your turn.</li>
          <li>Winning: The first player to get rid of all their cards wins.</li>
          <li>Tiebreaker: If no one can play, the player with the fewest points on their remaining cards wins.</li>
