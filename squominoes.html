      <h1>Here are the rules of Squominoes:</h1>
      
      <div style="margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;">
        <h2>
          - Shuffle the deck.
          - Deal each player six (6) cards.
          - Place the remaining cards face down to the side.
          - The youngest player places a Squominoe first.
          - Once you play a card, don't forget to pick one up from the deck.
          - Going clockwise, the next player will connect one of their cards to a card on the table.
          - The goal is to try and get rid of as many of your cards as possible.

          General Rules:
          - If you can't play any Squominoes, keep picking up from the deck until you can.
          - If the play area is full, total up all of the numbers on every one of your cards, the lowest number wins.
          - If a player has no cards left in their hand, they win.
          - The play area is determined by the amount of players...
          - - 2 Players - 3 x 3 grid
          - - 3 Players - 4 x 4 grid
          - - 4 Players - 5 x 5 grid
          - - and so on...
