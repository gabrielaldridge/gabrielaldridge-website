          Gabriel's Auditory Playground is my final submission at university. 
          I want to make a game with no visuals, that will be as accessible for the visually impaired as it is for anyone else.

          We finally have high scores! Once the zombie survival minigame is selected, it will read your highscore to you so you know what you're aiming for before jumping in.

        <h3>
          Today's challenge has been to spruce up the camera to make it less static. 
          I don't want any gameplay information portrayed through any visual UI so adding some particle effects did the trick. 
          On top of that, I've been messing around with the main menu and game over states to ensure they all flow as well as they possibly can.

        <h3>
          I've spent most of the day polishing up a prototype to send to a few testers, streamlining the menu and tutorial as well as drawing up a few marketing materials. 
          I've also included a pulsating logo to show the game is responsive on the off chance a game-breaking bug is unleashed.

          At this point of the development cycle, the first minigame is in its prototyping phase.
          I've added a Shephard Tone that increases in volume depending on the distance between the player and the closest enemy.
