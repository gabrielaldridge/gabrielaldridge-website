        <h2>
          Introducing the newest VR game in development, "MR Sports"! üèÄ

          Using hand tracking and the Meta Quest's passthrough feature (imagine your living room and not an endless black abyss), "MR Sports" will offer a highly immersive, intuitive, and interactive experience.

          While you can't move in the game, it's designed to be played like an arcade game, giving you the chance to show off your skills and compete with friends.

          And this is just the beginning. Keep an eye on "MR Sports" and get ready to experience your favourite sports like never before.

          "MR Sports" is the product of months of research to determine how accessible and intuitive VR can be. With the use of hand tracking, there is no need for a first-time user to learn the layout of a controller. The passthrough feature also keeps the player aware of their surroundings, making them feel less vulnerable whilst also limiting motion sickness.
